### Multi-Account Configuration

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "xmpp": {
      "accounts": {
        "work": {
          "jid": "workbot@company.com",
          "password": "work-pass",
          "groups": ["team@conference.company.com"]
        },
        "personal": {
          "jid": "mybot@xmpp.net",
          "password": "personal-pass",
          "dmPolicy": "open"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Direct Chat Policies

- **disabled** — Only owner JIDs (in `allowFrom`) can direct-chat the bot
- **open** — Accept direct chats from any sender
- **pairing** — Guests get a pairing code; approve via `openclaw pairing approve xmpp:<code>`
- **allowlist** — Only owner JIDs and JIDs in `dmAllowlist` may direct-chat; owners cannot be removed by the agent

## Group Chat Policies

- **open** — Respond to all messages in configured group rooms
- **allowlist** — Only respond to messages from JIDs in `groupAllowFrom` (falls back to `allowFrom`)

### Important: Non-Anonymous Rooms Required for `groupAllowFrom`

For `groupAllowFrom` to work properly, your MUC rooms must be configured as **non-anonymous**. In non-anonymous rooms, the server includes the sender's real JID in presence stanzas, which the plugin uses to verify the sender against the allowlist.

**Room Anonymity Types:**

| Type | Who Can See Real JIDs | Default in Prosody? |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Non-anonymous | Everyone in the room | No |
| Semi-anonymous | Only moderators | **Yes** (user-created rooms) |
| Anonymous | No one | No |

In **semi-anonymous** rooms (the default for user-created rooms in Prosody), only moderators can see real JIDs. Since the bot is typically a participant, it cannot see real JIDs and `groupAllowFrom` won't work.

**Prosody Configuration:**

```lua
Component "conference.example.com" "muc"
  -- Option 1: Make all rooms non-anonymous by default
  default_room_options = {
    anonymous = false;
  }
  
  -- Option 2: Use members-only rooms (automatically non-anonymous)
  default_room_options = {
    members_only = true;
  }
```

**Alternative: Make the bot a moderator**

If you can't change room anonymity settings, make the bot's JID a moderator in the room. Moderators can see real JIDs even in semi-anonymous rooms.

**ejabberd Configuration:**
```yaml
# In ejabberd.yml
modules:
  mod_muc:
    default_room_options:
      anonymous: false
```

If the room is semi-anonymous or anonymous and the bot cannot see real JIDs, the plugin will allow messages from all occupants in the room (since the room itself is already configured in `groups`).

## Actions

### Reactions (XEP-0444)

Enable reactions in config:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "xmpp": {
      "actions": {
        "reactions": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent can then use the `react` action to add/remove reactions to messages.

### OMEMO Encryption (XEP-0384)

Enable end-to-end encryption with OMEMO:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "xmpp": {
      "omemo": {
        "enabled": true,
        "deviceLabel": "OpenClaw Bot"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When OMEMO is enabled:
- The bot automatically publishes its device ID and key bundle via PEP
- Incoming encrypted messages are automatically decrypted
- Outgoing messages are automatically encrypted for all recipient devices
- Group chat messages are encrypted for all room occupants (requires non-anonymous rooms)
- The bot uses **always-trust** policy (accepts any identity key without verification)
- Keys are persisted across restarts via OpenClaw's key-value storage

#### OMEMO Requirements

- **Server:** Must support PEP (XEP-0163). Most modern servers (Prosody, ejabberd) support this.
- **Group Rooms:** Must be configured as "non-anonymous" for OMEMO to work. This allows the bot to discover real JIDs of occupants.
- **Clients:** Use an OMEMO-capable client like Conversations or Gajim.

#### OMEMO Technical Details

- Uses the **legacy OMEMO namespace** (`eu.siacs.conversations.axolotl`) for maximum compatibility with Conversations and Gajim
- Signal protocol via `@privacyresearch/libsignal-protocol-typescript`
- AES-128-GCM payload encryption (OMEMO 0.3 format)
- Supports both prekey (initial) and regular Signal messages

#### OMEMO Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Messages not encrypting | OMEMO not enabled | Add `"omemo": { "enabled": true }` to config |
| Can't decrypt in group | Room is semi-anonymous | Configure room as "non-anonymous" in server |
| Client doesn't see bot's device | Device not published | Restart openclaw; check PEP is enabled on server |
| "No devices found" error | Can't fetch recipient's device list | Ensure recipient has OMEMO enabled; check PEP access |
| Decryption fails after restart | Keys not persisted | Check OpenClaw data directory is writable |
| Old messages unreadable | Forward secrecy | Normal - OMEMO can't decrypt messages from before session |

**Clearing OMEMO State:**

If you need to reset OMEMO keys (e.g., after corruption), delete the OMEMO store from OpenClaw's key-value storage and restart. The bot will generate new keys and republish its device.
